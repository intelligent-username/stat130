# S:

What does this code do?

```python
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Population
population_parameter_mu_μ = 0
population_parameter_sigma_σ = 1
normal_distribution = stats.norm(loc=population_parameter_mu_μ, 
                                 scale=population_parameter_sigma_σ) 
# Sample
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
# np.random.seed(130)
x = normal_distribution.rvs(size=n) # "x" is the sample of size "n"
# print(x) # uncomment this if you also want to see the sample 

# Mean
print("The sample mean for the current sample is", x.mean()) 
# the sample mean "x-bar" is a (sample) "statistic" (not a "parameter")
# "x-bar" is the "average" of the numbers in a sample
```

# C:

This code generates a sample from a normal distribution and calculates the sample mean. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Import Libraries**: It imports the `stats` module from `scipy` and `numpy` as `np`.
2. **Define Population Parameters**: It sets the mean (`μ`) to 0 and the standard deviation (`σ`) to 1 for the normal distribution.
3. **Create Normal Distribution**: It creates a normal distribution object with the specified mean and standard deviation.
4. **Generate Sample**: It generates a sample of size `n` (100 in this case) from the normal distribution.
5. **Calculate Sample Mean**: It calculates and prints the mean of the generated sample.

The sample mean is a statistic that estimates the population mean. If you uncomment the `print(x)` line, you can see the actual sample values.

# This code visualizes the population being sampled from (as a red line),
# a sample from this population (as a histogram), and the sample mean

# create another sample
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
# np.random.seed(130)
x = normal_distribution.rvs(size=n) # "x" is the sample of size "n"

# create a histogram of the sample and annotate the sample mean
fig = px.histogram(pd.DataFrame({'sampled values': x}), x='sampled values',
                   histnorm='probability density') # so the scale matches the pdf below
fig.add_vline(x=x.mean(), line_dash="dot", annotation_text='Sample mean '+str(x.mean()))

# add population visualization into the figure
support = np.linspace(-4,4,100) 
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(mode='lines', name='Poulation Model<br>(normal distribution)',
                         y=normal_distribution.pdf(support), x=support))
                                             # pdf means "probability density function"

```

# C:

This code visualizes a sample from a normal distribution along with the population distribution. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Generate Another Sample**: It generates a new sample of size `n` (100 in this case) from the normal distribution.
2. **Create Histogram**: It creates a histogram of the sample values, normalizing the histogram to match the probability density function (PDF) scale.
3. **Annotate Sample Mean**: It adds a vertical line at the sample mean with an annotation.
4. **Add Population Visualization**: It plots the PDF of the normal distribution (the population model) as a red line.
5. **Display the Plot**: It shows the plot, which includes both the histogram of the sample and the PDF of the population.

This visualization helps to compare the sample distribution with the theoretical population distribution. If you have any questions about specific parts of the code or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

```python
# What is this doing?

number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    # np.random.seed(130) # ?
    simulated_means[i] = stats.norm(loc=0, scale=1).rvs(size=n).mean()
```

# C:

This code performs a simulation to estimate the distribution of sample means from a normal distribution. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Set Number of Simulations**: It sets the number of simulations to 1000.
2. **Initialize Array for Simulated Means**: It creates an array of zeros to store the mean of each simulated sample.
3. **Set Sample Size**: It sets the sample size `n` to 100.
4. **Run Simulations**: It runs a loop 1000 times (the number of simulations):
   - In each iteration, it generates a sample of size `n` from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
   - It calculates the mean of this sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

The `np.random.seed(130)` lines are commented out. If uncommented, they would ensure that the random number generation is reproducible, meaning you would get the same results every time you run the code.

This simulation helps to understand the sampling distribution of the sample mean. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

which commented line should I uncomment?

# C:

You should uncomment the line `np.random.seed(130)` **before** the loop if you want to ensure that the entire simulation is reproducible. This will make sure that every time you run the code, you get the same sequence of random numbers for all simulations.

Here's the modified code:

```python
number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

np.random.seed(130) # Set the seed for reproducibility
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    simulated_means[i] = stats.norm(loc=0, scale=1).rvs(size=n).mean()
```

Uncommenting the seed inside the loop would reset the random number generator for each iteration, which is generally not what you want for simulations like this.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

what would uncommenting the second one do?

# C:

Uncommenting the second `np.random.seed(130)` line inside the loop would reset the random number generator at the start of each iteration. This means that every sample generated in each iteration would be identical, leading to the same sample mean being calculated repeatedly.

Here's what the code would look like with the second seed uncommented:

```python
number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    np.random.seed(130) # Reset the seed in each iteration
    simulated_means[i] = stats.norm(loc=0, scale=1).rvs(size=n).mean()
```

In this case, `simulated_means` would contain the same value repeated 1000 times, which defeats the purpose of the simulation. The goal is to see the variability in sample means, so resetting the seed inside the loop is generally not desirable.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

```

# C:

This code visualizes the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Create Histogram of Simulated Means**: It creates a histogram of the simulated sample means, normalizing the histogram to match the probability density function (PDF) scale.
2. **Set Titles**: It sets the titles for the histogram plot.
3. **Add Theoretical Distribution**: It calculates the theoretical distribution of the sample means (the sampling distribution) and adds it as a red line to the plot.
4. **Display the Plot**: It shows the plot, which includes both the histogram of the simulated sample means and the theoretical sampling distribution.

This visualization helps to compare the empirical distribution of the sample means from the simulations with the theoretical normal distribution of the sample means. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

what's the difference between "the empirical distribution of the sample means" and the "theoretical normal distribution of the sample means"?

# C:

Great question! Let's break down the differences:

### Empirical Distribution of the Sample Means
- **Definition**: This is the distribution of the sample means obtained from actual data through repeated sampling.
- **Source**: It comes from the simulations or real-world data.
- **Characteristics**: It reflects the variability and randomness inherent in the sampling process. Each sample mean is calculated from a different sample, leading to a distribution that shows how these means are spread out.
- **Example**: In your code, the histogram of `simulated_means` represents the empirical distribution of the sample means.

### Theoretical Normal Distribution of the Sample Means
- **Definition**: This is the distribution predicted by statistical theory, specifically the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
- **Source**: It is derived from mathematical principles and assumptions about the population distribution.
- **Characteristics**: For a sufficiently large sample size, the CLT states that the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution, with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size ($$\sigma/\sqrt{n}$$).
- **Example**: In your code, the red line added to the plot represents the theoretical normal distribution of the sample means.

### Key Differences
- **Empirical vs. Theoretical**: The empirical distribution is based on actual data from simulations or experiments, while the theoretical distribution is based on statistical theory.
- **Variability**: The empirical distribution may show more variability and may not be perfectly normal, especially with smaller sample sizes or fewer simulations. The theoretical distribution is a smooth, idealized curve.
- **Purpose**: The empirical distribution helps to visualize and understand the actual outcomes of sampling, while the theoretical distribution provides a benchmark or expectation based on statistical principles.

Would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspect of these distributions?

# S:

# And in order to repeatedly simulate samples (means) like the ones we have, let's
# FALSELY pretend the population parameters are their corresponding statistics
country = 'Mexico<br>(n=236)'

PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean = df[df.origin==country].points.mean()
PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std = df[df.origin==country].points.std()

n = (df.origin==country).sum()

print("PRETENDING that the population mean μ is", PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean)
print("and the population standard deviation σ is", PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std)
print("we can repeatedly draw samples of size", n, "and compute their means...")

# C:

This code is setting up a simulation to repeatedly draw samples from a dataset, using the sample statistics as if they were the true population parameters. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Select Country**: It selects data for a specific country, in this case, Mexico, with a sample size of 236.
2. **Calculate Sample Statistics**: It calculates the mean and standard deviation of the points for the selected country.
   - `PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean`: The mean of the points for Mexico.
   - `PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std`: The standard deviation of the points for Mexico.
3. **Set Sample Size**: It sets the sample size `n` to the number of observations for Mexico.
4. **Print Statements**: It prints out the calculated sample mean and standard deviation, and indicates that these will be used as if they were the true population parameters for further simulations.

This approach allows you to simulate drawing samples from a population with known parameters, even though these parameters are actually estimated from the sample. This can be useful for understanding the behavior of sample means and other statistics under repeated sampling.

Would you like to see how to proceed with the simulation or have any other questions about this code?


# S:

Is this repeatedly drawing samples from a dataset?

# C:

No, this code is not repeatedly drawing samples from the actual dataset. Instead, it is setting up the parameters to simulate drawing samples from a theoretical population. Here's what's happening:

1. **Calculate Sample Statistics**: It calculates the mean and standard deviation of the points for Mexico from the dataset.
2. **Pretend These Are Population Parameters**: It uses these sample statistics as if they were the true population parameters.
3. **Set Sample Size**: It sets the sample size `n` to the number of observations for Mexico.

The next step would typically involve using these "pretend" population parameters to generate new samples from a normal distribution with the calculated mean and standard deviation. This is a common technique in simulations to understand the behavior of sample statistics under repeated sampling.

# C:

This code is simulating the process of drawing samples from a theoretical population, using the sample statistics as if they were the true population parameters. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Set Number of Simulations**: It sets the number of simulations to 1000.
2. **Initialize Array for Simulated Means**: It creates an array of zeros to store the mean of each simulated sample.
3. **Run Simulations**: It runs a loop 1000 times (the number of simulations):
   - In each iteration, it generates a sample of size `n` from a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation set to the previously calculated sample statistics (`PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean` and `PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std`).
   - It calculates the mean of this sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

The `np.random.seed(130)` line is commented out. If uncommented, it would ensure that the random number generation is reproducible, meaning you would get the same results every time you run the code.

This code visualizes the sampling distribution of the sample mean based on the simulated means. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Set Titles**: It sets the titles for the histogram plot.
   - `title1`: The main title of the plot.
   - `title2` and `title`: Descriptive titles indicating the number of simulations and sample size.

2. **Create Histogram of Simulated Means**: It creates a histogram of the simulated sample means, normalizing the histogram to match the probability density function (PDF) scale.

   - It calculates the range (`support`) for plotting the theoretical distribution of the sample means. This range is centered around the sample mean and extends 4 standard deviations on either side, scaled by the square root of the sample size.
   - `support` is then converted to a linearly spaced array for plotting.

2. **Create Gamma Distribution**: It creates a gamma distribution object with the specified shape and scale parameters.
3. **Generate Sample**: It generates a sample of size `n` (100 in this case) from the gamma distribution.
4. **Calculate Sample Mean**: It calculates and prints the mean of the generated sample.

The sample mean is a statistic that estimates the population mean. If you uncomment the `print(x)` line, you can see the actual sample values.

This visualization helps to compare the sample distribution with the theoretical population distribution. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

What does the line "n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this" do?

# C:

If you adjust the sample size `n`, you'll see how different sample sizes affect the distribution of the sample values and the sample mean. Here are a few things you might observe:

1. **Smaller Sample Size (e.g., n = 10)**:
   - The histogram might look more irregular and less smooth because there are fewer data points.
   - The sample mean might vary more from one sample to another, showing higher variability.

2. **Larger Sample Size (e.g., n = 1000)**:
   - The histogram will look smoother and more closely resemble the shape of the gamma distribution.
   - The sample mean will be more stable and closer to the population mean, showing less variability.

Experimenting with different sample sizes can help you understand the impact of sample size on the accuracy and reliability of statistical estimates. Would you like to try changing the sample size and see the results? If you need help with any specific part, just let me know!

```

# C:

This code is simulating the process of drawing samples from a gamma distribution and calculating the sample means. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Set Number of Simulations**: It sets the number of simulations to 1000.
2. **Initialize Array for Simulated Means**: It creates an array of zeros to store the mean of each simulated sample.
3. **Set Sample Size**: It sets the sample size `n` to 100.
4. **Run Simulations**: It runs a loop 1000 times (the number of simulations):
   - In each iteration, it generates a sample of size `n` from the gamma distribution.
   - It calculates the mean of this sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

The `np.random.seed(130)` lines are commented out. If uncommented, they would ensure that the random number generation is reproducible, meaning you would get the same results every time you run the code.

This simulation helps to understand the distribution of sample means when drawing from a gamma distribution. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

Do I want that?

# C:

Whether you want to uncomment the `np.random.seed(130)` line depends on your goals:

1. **Reproducibility**: If you want to ensure that you get the same results every time you run the code, uncommenting the `np.random.seed(130)` line **before** the loop is beneficial. This sets the seed for the random number generator, making your simulations reproducible.

   ```python
   np.random.seed(130) # Set the seed for reproducibility
   ```

2. **True Randomness**: If you prefer to see different results each time you run the code, you should leave the `np.random.seed(130)` line commented out. This allows the random number generator to produce different sequences of random numbers each time.

Uncommenting the seed inside the loop would reset the random number generator for each iteration, which is generally not desirable for simulations like this, as it would result in identical samples for each iteration.

Would you like to try running the code with the seed set for reproducibility, or do you have any other questions about this process?

# S:

do I need to run the code or wil you do that for me?

# C:

I can't run the code directly, but I can guide you through it! Running the code on your local machine or in an online Python environment will help you see the results and understand the process better.

This code visualizes the sampling distribution of the sample mean from the gamma distribution simulations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Set Titles with Hint**: It sets the titles for the histogram plot, including a hint about the effects of skew at small sample sizes.
   - `title1`: The main title of the plot, including the hint.
   - `title2`: Descriptive title indicating the number of simulations and sample size.

2. **Create Histogram of Simulated Means**: It creates a histogram of the simulated sample means, normalizing the histogram to match the probability density function (PDF) scale.

This visualization helps to compare the empirical distribution of the sample means from the simulations with the theoretical normal distribution of the sample means, highlighting how skew can affect the results, especially with smaller sample sizes.

Would you like to explore any specific part of this code further or have any other questions?

# S:

how would skew affect the results at small samples sizes?

# C:

Skewness can significantly impact the results, especially with small sample sizes. Here's how:

### 1. **Sample Mean Variability**:
   - **Small Samples**: With smaller samples, the sample mean can be more heavily influenced by extreme values (outliers). In a skewed distribution, these outliers are more likely to occur on one side of the distribution, causing the sample mean to be less representative of the population mean.
   - **Large Samples**: As the sample size increases, the influence of outliers diminishes, and the sample mean becomes a more reliable estimate of the population mean.

### 2. **Shape of the Distribution**:
   - **Small Samples**: The histogram of small samples from a skewed distribution may not resemble the theoretical distribution. It can appear more irregular and may not capture the skewness accurately.
   - **Large Samples**: With larger samples, the histogram will more closely approximate the shape of the population distribution, including its skewness.

### 3. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**:
   - **Small Samples**: The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough, regardless of the population distribution. However, with small samples, the sample means may not follow a normal distribution, especially if the population distribution is skewed.
   - **Large Samples**: As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean will tend to be normal, even if the population distribution is skewed.

### Visual Example:
Imagine drawing samples from a right-skewed distribution (e.g., income data where most people earn a moderate amount, but a few earn very high amounts):
- **Small Sample**: A small sample might include one or two high-income individuals, skewing the sample mean higher than the population mean.
- **Large Sample**: A large sample is more likely to include a representative mix of incomes, resulting in a sample mean closer to the population mean.

Would you like to see a specific example or have any other questions about skewness and its effects?

# S:

What you're describing is more general than what I'm looking for here. I think you should describe how the sampling distribution of the mean looks when sampling a small number of samples from a skewed distribution. I think what you're describing is the just the increased uncertainty resulting from small sample sizes, and not really specifically addressing skew directly.

# C:

Yes, I think the following is all that should be really emphasized here: "Irregular Shape: The sampling distribution of the mean (the distribution of sample means) will not look normal. It will reflect the skewness of the population, often showing a long tail on one side."

# C:

Absolutely! That's a great summary. When dealing with small sample sizes from a skewed distribution:

- **Irregular Shape**: The sampling distribution of the mean will not look normal. It will reflect the skewness of the population, often showing a long tail on one side.

This captures the essence of how skewness affects the sampling distribution of the mean with small samples. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

```python
country = 'Mexico<br>(n=236)' 

# bootstrapping is when `replace=True` and `n` is the original sample size
# and we do this over and over to see the behavior of sample statistics
n_ = (df.origin==country).sum() # This is the correct choice for bootstrapping, but why?
replace_ = True # This is the correct choice for bootstrapping, but why?

# We don't have a "poulation" any more... only the (original) "Sample"
x = df[df.origin==country].sample(n=n_, replace=replace_).points
# print(x)
print("The bootstrap sample mean for the current bootstrapped sample is", x.mean())
```

# C:

This code is performing a bootstrap sampling procedure. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and why the choices for `n_` and `replace_` are correct:

### Bootstrapping Explained:
- **Bootstrapping** is a resampling technique used to estimate the distribution of a statistic (like the mean) by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the original sample.

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Select Country**: It selects data for a specific country, in this case, Mexico, with a sample size of 236.
2. **Set Sample Size (`n_`)**: It sets `n_` to the number of observations for Mexico. This is the correct choice because bootstrapping involves resampling the original sample size.
3. **Set Replacement (`replace_`)**: It sets `replace_` to `True`. This is the correct choice because bootstrapping requires sampling with replacement, allowing the same data point to be selected multiple times in different resamples.
4. **Generate Bootstrap Sample**: It generates a bootstrap sample by sampling `n_` points from the original sample with replacement.
5. **Calculate Bootstrap Sample Mean**: It calculates and prints the mean of the bootstrap sample.

### Why These Choices Are Correct:
- **Sample Size (`n_`)**: Using the original sample size ensures that each bootstrap sample is comparable to the original sample, maintaining the same level of variability.
- **Replacement (`replace_`)**: Sampling with replacement allows for the creation of multiple different samples from the original data, which is essential for estimating the variability of the statistic.

This process helps to understand the behavior of sample statistics and provides a way to estimate their distribution without needing to make assumptions about the population distribution.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

why is it that "Sampling with replacement allows for the creation of multiple different samples"?

# C:

Sampling with replacement means that each time you select a data point from the original sample, you put it back before selecting the next one. This allows the same data point to be chosen multiple times in different samples. Here's why this is important:

### Multiple Different Samples:
- **Variety**: Each bootstrap sample can include different combinations of data points, even though they come from the same original sample. This creates a variety of samples.
- **Independence**: Each sample is independent of the others, which helps in estimating the variability of the statistic (like the mean).
- **Representation**: By allowing repeated selection, you can better capture the variability and characteristics of the original sample.

### Example:
Imagine you have an original sample of 5 data points: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- **Without Replacement**: You can only create one sample that includes all 5 points.
- **With Replacement**: You can create multiple samples, such as [1, 2, 2, 4, 5], [3, 3, 3, 4, 5], etc.

This process helps to generate a distribution of the sample statistic, providing insights into its variability and confidence intervals.

Does this help clarify why sampling with replacement is used in bootstrapping?

# S:

```python
# what is this doing?

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
x = df[df.origin==country].sample(n=n_, replace=replace_).points

dat = pd.DataFrame({'sample values': np.r_[df[df.origin==country].points.values, x],
                    'sample': np.r_[['Orginal Sample']*(df.origin==country).sum(),
                                    ['Bootstrap Sample']*n_]})             

fig = px.histogram(dat, x="sample values", color="sample", barmode="overlay")
fig.add_vline(x=x.mean(), line_dash="dot", annotation_text='Bootstrapped sample mean<br>'+str(x.mean()))
fig.show() # USE `fig.show(renderer="png")` FOR ALL GitHub and MarkUs SUBMISSIONS    
```

# C:

This code is visualizing the original sample and a bootstrap sample from the dataset. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Generate Bootstrap Sample**:
   - It generates a bootstrap sample by sampling `n_` points from the original sample with replacement.
   - The `np.random.seed(130)` line is commented out. If uncommented, it would ensure reproducibility.

2. **Create DataFrame for Visualization**:
   - It creates a DataFrame `dat` that combines the original sample values and the bootstrap sample values.
   - The DataFrame has two columns: `'sample values'` and `'sample'`, where `'sample'` indicates whether the value is from the original sample or the bootstrap sample.

3. **Create Histogram**:
   - It creates a histogram using Plotly Express (`px.histogram`) to visualize the distribution of the original sample and the bootstrap sample.
   - The histogram uses different colors to distinguish between the original sample and the bootstrap sample, with the bars overlaid (`barmode="overlay"`).

4. **Annotate Bootstrap Sample Mean**:
   - It adds a vertical line at the mean of the bootstrap sample with an annotation.

5. **Display the Plot**:
   - It shows the plot, which includes the histogram of the original sample and the bootstrap sample, along with the annotated bootstrap sample mean.

This visualization helps to compare the distribution of the original sample with the bootstrap sample and see how the bootstrap sample mean relates to the original data.

# S:

```python
# what is this doing?

number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n_ = 100 # adjust and experiment with this # 236 # 
# for bootstrapping it should be (df.origin==country).sum()
# if it's not, it's not bootstrapping... it's something else...
# ...not sure what it would then be called... maybe a "Monte Carlo" method? Sample from a discrete/empirical distirbution?

# was the same size as the origina sample size n, and this was `False`?

# C:

This code is performing a simulation to estimate the distribution of sample means using bootstrapping. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Set Number of Simulations**: It sets the number of simulations to 1000.
2. **Initialize Array for Simulated Means**: It creates an array of zeros to store the mean of each simulated sample.
3. **Set Sample Size (`n_`)**: It sets the sample size `n_` to 100. The comment suggests that for true bootstrapping, `n_` should be the size of the original sample (236 in this case).
4. **Set Replacement (`replace_`)**: It sets `replace_` to `True`, which is necessary for bootstrapping to allow sampling with replacement.
5. **Run Simulations**: It runs a loop 1000 times (the number of simulations):
   - In each iteration, it generates a bootstrap sample by sampling `n_` points from the original sample with replacement.
   - It calculates the mean of this bootstrap sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

### Comments and Questions in the Code:
- **`np.random.seed(130)`**: If uncommented, it would ensure reproducibility of the random sampling.
- **Sample Size (`n_`)**: The comment notes that if `n_` is not the size of the original sample, the process is not true bootstrapping. Instead, it might be considered a Monte Carlo method, where samples are drawn from an empirical distribution.
- **Replacement (`replace_`)**: The comment questions what would happen if `replace` were `False`. If `replace` were `False` and `n_` were the same as the original sample size, it would simply shuffle the original sample without replacement, which is not bootstrapping.

### Key Points:
- **Bootstrapping**: Involves sampling with replacement and using the original sample size to estimate the distribution of a statistic.
- **Monte Carlo Method**: Involves drawing samples from an empirical distribution, which can be done with or without replacement, and may use different sample sizes.

Would you like to explore any specific part of this code further or have any other questions?

# S:

So is this bootstrapping?

# C:

Yes, this code is performing bootstrapping. Here's why:

### Key Characteristics of Bootstrapping:
1. **Sampling with Replacement**: The code sets `replace=True`, which means each bootstrap sample is drawn with replacement from the original sample.
2. **Sample Size**: The sample size `n_` is set to 100, but for true bootstrapping, it should match the size of the original sample (236 in this case). The comment suggests adjusting `n_` to the original sample size for proper bootstrapping.
3. **Repeated Sampling**: The code runs 1000 simulations, each time drawing a new bootstrap sample and calculating its mean.

### What the Code Does:
- It repeatedly draws samples from the original dataset with replacement.
- It calculates the mean of each bootstrap sample.
- It stores these means in an array to analyze the distribution of the sample means.

### Adjustments for True Bootstrapping:
- Set `n_` to the size of the original sample (236) to ensure each bootstrap sample is the same size as the original sample.

Here's the adjusted code for true bootstrapping:

```python
number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n_ = (df.origin==country).sum() # Use the original sample size for bootstrapping
replace_ = True # Sampling with replacement

for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    simulated_means[i] = df[df.origin==country].sample(n=n_, replace=replace_).points.mean()
```

This ensures that the process is true bootstrapping, allowing you to estimate the distribution of the sample mean accurately.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

So it's only bootstrapping if I use your code?

# C:

Not necessarily! The key elements that make a process bootstrapping are:

1. **Sampling with Replacement**: Ensuring that each sample is drawn with replacement from the original dataset.
2. **Sample Size**: Using the same sample size as the original dataset.

In your original code, if you set `n_` to the size of the original sample (236) and keep `replace=True`, it would be considered bootstrapping. Here's how you can adjust your code:

```python
number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n_ = (df.origin==country).sum() # Use the original sample size for bootstrapping
replace_ = True # Sampling with replacement

for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    simulated_means[i] = df[df.origin==country].sample(n=n_, replace=replace_).points.mean()
```

This ensures that each bootstrap sample is the same size as the original sample and is drawn with replacement, making it true bootstrapping.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

# S:

Oh so I just have to make that change and then it's bootstrapping?

# C:

Exactly! By setting `n_` to the size of the original sample and ensuring `replace=True`, your code will be performing true bootstrapping. Here's the adjusted snippet:

```python
number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n_ = (df.origin==country).sum() # Use the original sample size for bootstrapping
replace_ = True # Sampling with replacement

for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    simulated_means[i] = df[df.origin==country].sample(n=n_, replace=replace_).points.mean()
```

This ensures that each bootstrap sample is the same size as the original sample and is drawn with replacement, making it true bootstrapping.
