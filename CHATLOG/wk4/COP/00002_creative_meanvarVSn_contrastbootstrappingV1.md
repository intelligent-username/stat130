Jul 16, 2024: variability/uncertainty of sample mean versus sample size answered well, but bootstrapping not explained particularly well

# S:

How does the variability/uncertainty of means of simulated samples change as a function of sample size? Can you explain why this is in an intuitive way?

# C:

Sure, I'd be happy to explain!

When we talk about the variability or uncertainty of the means of simulated samples, we're referring to how much the sample means differ from each other. This variability is often measured by the standard error of the mean (SEM).

**Key Concept:**
- **Standard Error of the Mean (SEM):** This is the standard deviation of the sample means. It tells us how much the sample mean is expected to vary from the true population mean.

**How It Changes with Sample Size:**
- As the sample size increases, the SEM decreases. This means that the means of larger samples are less variable and more tightly clustered around the true population mean.

**Intuitive Explanation:**
- Imagine you're trying to estimate the average height of people in a city. If you only measure 5 people, your estimate might be quite off because those 5 people might not represent the whole city well. But if you measure 500 people, your estimate will likely be much closer to the true average height because the larger sample is more representative of the population.

**Why This Happens:**
- **Law of Large Numbers:** As the sample size increases, the sample mean gets closer to the population mean. This reduces the variability of the sample means.
- **Averaging Effect:** In larger samples, extreme values (very high or very low) are averaged out more effectively, leading to a more stable and accurate estimate of the mean.

In summary, larger sample sizes lead to less variability in the sample means, making our estimates more reliable. Does that help clarify things?

# S:

Can you explain what bootstrapping is, contrasting it with instead sampling from a normal or gamma population?

# C:

Absolutely! Let's break down bootstrapping and compare it with sampling from a normal or gamma population.

### Bootstrapping
**Bootstrapping** is a statistical method that involves repeatedly sampling with replacement from a dataset to estimate the distribution of a statistic (like the mean, median, or variance). Here’s how it works:

1. **Original Sample:** Start with your original dataset.
2. **Resampling:** Randomly draw samples from this dataset with replacement, creating many "bootstrap samples."
3. **Statistic Calculation:** Calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean) for each bootstrap sample.
4. **Distribution Estimation:** Use the distribution of these statistics to estimate the variability and confidence intervals of the original statistic.

**Key Points:**
- **With Replacement:** Each bootstrap sample can include the same data points multiple times.
- **Non-parametric:** No assumptions about the underlying population distribution.

### Sampling from a Normal or Gamma Population
When you sample from a normal or gamma population, you assume that the data follows a specific distribution (normal or gamma). Here’s a brief overview:

1. **Normal Distribution:** Characterized by its bell shape, defined by the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).
2. **Gamma Distribution:** Skewed distribution, defined by shape (k) and scale (θ) parameters.

**Key Points:**
- **Parametric:** Assumes a specific form for the population distribution.
- **Direct Sampling:** Draw samples directly from the assumed distribution.

### Comparison
- **Assumptions:**
  - **Bootstrapping:** Makes no assumptions about the population distribution.
  - **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Assumes data follows a normal or gamma distribution.

- **Flexibility:**
  - **Bootstrapping:** More flexible, can be used with any dataset.
  - **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Limited to situations where the population distribution is known or assumed.

- **Use Cases:**
  - **Bootstrapping:** Useful when the population distribution is unknown or complex.
  - **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Useful when the population distribution is well-understood and fits the data.

### Intuitive Example
- **Bootstrapping:** Imagine you have a bag of mixed candies, and you want to estimate the average weight of the candies. You repeatedly draw candies from the bag (with replacement) and calculate the average weight each time. This helps you understand the variability in the average weight.
- **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Instead, if you know the candies' weights follow a normal distribution, you can directly sample weights from this distribution to estimate the average.

Does this help clarify the concept of bootstrapping and how it contrasts with sampling from a normal or gamma population?

# S:

This is very high level. Can you first explicitly define the process of bootstrapping?

# C:

Absolutely, let's break down the bootstrapping process step-by-step:

### Bootstrapping Process

1. **Original Sample:**
   - Start with your original dataset, which we'll call \( X \). This dataset has \( n \) observations: \( X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \).

2. **Resampling:**
   - Create a new sample (called a "bootstrap sample") by randomly selecting \( n \) observations from \( X \) **with replacement**. This means each observation can be chosen multiple times.
   - Repeat this process \( B \) times to create \( B \) bootstrap samples. Each bootstrap sample will also have \( n \) observations.

3. **Statistic Calculation:**
   - For each bootstrap sample, calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, variance). Let's denote the statistic calculated from the \( i \)-th bootstrap sample as \( \theta^*_i \).

4. **Distribution Estimation:**
   - After calculating the statistic for all \( B \) bootstrap samples, you will have a distribution of the statistic: \( \{\theta^*_1, \theta^*_2, \ldots, \theta^*_B\} \).
   - This distribution can be used to estimate the variability, bias, and confidence intervals of the statistic.

### Example

Let's say you have a dataset of 10 numbers and you want to estimate the mean and its variability:

1. **Original Sample:** \( X = \{2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18\} \).

2. **Resampling:**
   - Create a bootstrap sample by randomly selecting 10 numbers from \( X \) with replacement. For example, one bootstrap sample might be \( \{4, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12, 12, 15, 18, 18\} \).
   - Repeat this process 1000 times to create 1000 bootstrap samples.

3. **Statistic Calculation:**
   - Calculate the mean for each of the 1000 bootstrap samples. You will get 1000 means.

4. **Distribution Estimation:**
   - Use the 1000 means to estimate the variability and confidence intervals of the mean of the original dataset.

### Why Use Bootstrapping?

- **No Assumptions:** It doesn't assume any specific distribution for the data.
- **Versatile:** Can be used for a wide range of statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.).
- **Practical:** Useful when the theoretical distribution of the statistic is complex or unknown.

Does this detailed breakdown help clarify the bootstrapping process?

# S:

can you describe this one more time but be very clear what you mean by the word distribution when you use it?

# C:

Absolutely, let's go through the bootstrapping process again, with a clear focus on what "distribution" means in this context.

### Bootstrapping Process

1. **Original Sample:**
   - Start with your original dataset, which we'll call \( X \). This dataset has \( n \) observations: \( X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \).

2. **Resampling:**
   - Create a new sample (called a "bootstrap sample") by randomly selecting \( n \) observations from \( X \) **with replacement**. This means each observation can be chosen multiple times.
   - Repeat this process \( B \) times to create \( B \) bootstrap samples. Each bootstrap sample will also have \( n \) observations.

3. **Statistic Calculation:**
   - For each bootstrap sample, calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, variance). Let's denote the statistic calculated from the \( i \)-th bootstrap sample as \( \theta^*_i \).

4. **Distribution Estimation:**
   - After calculating the statistic for all \( B \) bootstrap samples, you will have a collection of these statistics: \( \{\theta^*_1, \theta^*_2, \ldots, \theta^*_B\} \).
   - This collection forms a **distribution** of the statistic. In this context, "distribution" refers to the range and frequency of the calculated statistics from the bootstrap samples. It shows how the statistic varies across different samples.

### Example

Let's say you have a dataset of 10 numbers and you want to estimate the mean and its variability:

1. **Original Sample:** \( X = \{2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18\} \).

2. **Resampling:**
   - Create a bootstrap sample by randomly selecting 10 numbers from \( X \) with replacement. For example, one bootstrap sample might be \( \{4, 7, 7, 8, 10, 12, 12, 15, 18, 18\} \).
   - Repeat this process 1000 times to create 1000 bootstrap samples.

3. **Statistic Calculation:**
   - Calculate the mean for each of the 1000 bootstrap samples. You will get 1000 means.

4. **Distribution Estimation:**
   - The 1000 means form a **distribution** of the mean. This distribution shows how the mean varies across the 1000 bootstrap samples. You can visualize this distribution with a histogram, which will show the frequency of different mean values.

### Why Use Bootstrapping?

- **No Assumptions:** It doesn't assume any specific distribution for the data.
- **Versatile:** Can be used for a wide range of statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.).
- **Practical:** Useful when the theoretical distribution of the statistic is complex or unknown.

In summary, when I mention "distribution" in the context of bootstrapping, I'm referring to the range and frequency of the calculated statistics (like means) from the multiple bootstrap samples. This distribution helps us understand the variability and confidence intervals of the statistic.

Does this make the concept clearer?

# S:

When you say "each observation can be chosen multiple times" you would also then say that some observations in the orignal sample might not be chosen at all, right? And I think the collection of bootrapped statistics might be more accuractely called an empirical distribution, right?

# C:

Yes, you're absolutely right on both points!

1. **Observations Not Chosen:**
   - When creating bootstrap samples, some observations from the original sample might not be chosen at all. This is because we are sampling with replacement, meaning each draw is independent and can include any observation, including those already chosen.

2. **Empirical Distribution:**
   - The collection of bootstrapped statistics is indeed more accurately called an **empirical distribution**. This term emphasizes that the distribution is derived from the data itself, rather than assuming any theoretical distribution.

### Clarified Bootstrapping Process

1. **Original Sample:**
   - Start with your original dataset, \( X \), with \( n \) observations: \( X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \).

2. **Resampling:**
   - Create a new sample by randomly selecting \( n \) observations from \( X \) with replacement. Some observations may be chosen multiple times, while others might not be chosen at all.
   - Repeat this process \( B \) times to create \( B \) bootstrap samples.

3. **Statistic Calculation:**
   - Calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean) for each bootstrap sample, resulting in \( \{\theta^*_1, \theta^*_2, \ldots, \theta^*_B\} \).

4. **Empirical Distribution:**
   - The collection of these statistics forms an empirical distribution, showing the range and frequency of the statistic based on the resampled data.

This empirical distribution helps us understand the variability and confidence intervals of the statistic without making assumptions about the underlying population distribution.

Does this help clarify things further?

# S:

How could this be compared and constrated to if I sampled from a normal or gamma population instead of doing bootstrapping the way you described?

# C:

Great question! Let's compare and contrast bootstrapping with sampling from a normal or gamma population.

### Bootstrapping

**Process:**
1. **Original Sample:** Start with your dataset.
2. **Resampling:** Create multiple bootstrap samples by sampling with replacement from the original dataset.
3. **Statistic Calculation:** Calculate the statistic of interest for each bootstrap sample.
4. **Empirical Distribution:** Form an empirical distribution of the statistic from the bootstrap samples.

**Key Points:**
- **No Assumptions:** Does not assume any specific distribution for the data.
- **Empirical Distribution:** The distribution of the statistic is derived from the data itself.
- **Flexibility:** Can be used with any dataset, regardless of its underlying distribution.

### Sampling from a Normal or Gamma Population

**Process:**
1. **Assume Distribution:** Assume the data follows a normal or gamma distribution.
2. **Parameter Estimation:** Estimate the parameters of the distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation for normal, shape and scale for gamma).
3. **Direct Sampling:** Draw samples directly from the assumed distribution using the estimated parameters.
4. **Theoretical Distribution:** The distribution of the statistic is based on the theoretical properties of the assumed distribution.

**Key Points:**
- **Assumptions:** Assumes the data follows a specific distribution (normal or gamma).
- **Theoretical Distribution:** The distribution of the statistic is based on the theoretical properties of the assumed distribution.
- **Parameter Dependency:** The accuracy of the results depends on how well the assumed distribution fits the data.

### Comparison

1. **Assumptions:**
   - **Bootstrapping:** No assumptions about the underlying distribution.
   - **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Assumes a specific distribution (normal or gamma).

2. **Distribution Type:**
   - **Bootstrapping:** Empirical distribution derived from the data.
   - **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Theoretical distribution based on assumed parameters.

3. **Flexibility:**
   - **Bootstrapping:** More flexible, applicable to any dataset.
   - **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Limited to situations where the data fits the assumed distribution.

4. **Use Cases:**
   - **Bootstrapping:** Useful when the population distribution is unknown or complex.
   - **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Useful when the population distribution is well-understood and fits the data.

### Intuitive Example

- **Bootstrapping:** Imagine you have a bag of mixed candies and you want to estimate the average weight. You repeatedly draw candies from the bag (with replacement) and calculate the average weight each time. This helps you understand the variability in the average weight based on the actual data.
- **Normal/Gamma Sampling:** Instead, if you know the candies' weights follow a normal distribution, you can directly sample weights from this distribution to estimate the average. This relies on the assumption that the weights are normally distributed.

In summary, bootstrapping is a non-parametric method that relies on the data itself to estimate the distribution of a statistic, while sampling from a normal or gamma population relies on theoretical distributions and assumptions about the data. Both methods have their own strengths and are useful in different scenarios. 

Does this comparison help clarify the differences?

# S:

Do I estimate the parameters that I use to define my distributions?

Yes, when you sample from a normal or gamma population, you typically need to estimate the parameters of the distribution from your data. Here's how you do it:

### Estimating Parameters

1. **Normal Distribution:**
   - **Parameters:** Mean (\(\mu\)) and standard deviation (\(\sigma\)).
   - **Estimation:**
     - **Mean (\(\mu\))**: Calculate the average of your data.
     - **Standard Deviation (\(\sigma\))**: Calculate the standard deviation of your data.

2. **Gamma Distribution:**
   - **Parameters:** Shape (\(k\)) and scale (\(\theta\)).
   - **Estimation:**
     - **Shape (\(k\))**: Often estimated using methods like the method of moments or maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
     - **Scale (\(\theta\))**: Similarly estimated using methods like the method of moments or MLE.

### Example

Let's say you have a dataset and you want to sample from a normal distribution:

1. **Original Data:** \( X = \{2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18\} \).

2. **Estimate Parameters:**
   - **Mean (\(\mu\))**: Calculate the average of \( X \).
     \[
     \mu = \frac{2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 15 + 18}{10} = 9.5
     \]
   - **Standard Deviation (\(\sigma\))**: Calculate the standard deviation of \( X \).
     \[
     \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{n-1}} \approx 5.32
     \]

3. **Sampling:**
   - Use the estimated parameters (\(\mu = 9.5\), \(\sigma = 5.32\)) to draw samples from a normal distribution.

For a gamma distribution, the process is similar but involves estimating the shape and scale parameters, which might require more complex calculations or software tools.

### Why Estimate Parameters?

- **Accuracy:** Ensures that the samples you draw reflect the characteristics of your actual data.
- **Applicability:** Allows you to use theoretical distributions to model and analyze your data.

Does this help clarify how you estimate parameters for defining distributions?
